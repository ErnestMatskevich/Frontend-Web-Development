    I am a freshman student at Innopolis University. I started my journey in IT with the study of robotics.
    Not so long ago I became interested in front-end development. I have some experience in mobile development.
    Soft skills are well developed, there is experience in working with the public and in holding events.<br>
    Now I work as a tourist guide in the city of Innopolis
